# repl-knowMe-quiz
 created a quiz about myself using node.js and hosted it on Repl.
 It gives the user a score at the end on the basis of the answers given.

 This was my first program using Node.js and I learnt about: 

 1. how to import a package.
 1. how to use "readline-sync"
 1. conditional programming in node.js
 1. basics of a function
 1. for loop basics
 1. array and object basics
